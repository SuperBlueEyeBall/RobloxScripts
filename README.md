Welcome fellow exp!oiters!!! This my list of scripts for exploiting that I've collected over my fair share of exp!oiting in rob!ox!!
I do NOT own most of these scripts. I am not claiming to own most scripts, but just redistributing them for all exp!oiters to see. I hope you understand if you are one of the script owners.
If you want, you can file a pull request and I can add some of your scripts here! I can also take some down if you want.

## Loadstring preset:

```lua

loadstring(game:HttpGet(""))()

```

## Game Loader:

```lua

loadstring(game:HttpGet(""))():load(game.PlaceId)

```

## Tips n tricks:
Use bypassers to bypass pesky link redirectors that make you watch ads such as sub2get, lootdest, and linktiverse. Ill give you great bypassers below if you dont have any already.
By the way, this is all possible through userscript managers on browser in the form of extensions. Tampermonkey is a popular userscript manager, as well as violentmonkey which is similar and works better for kiwi browser if you're on mobile. I will also provide you the link for the userscript managers too below:
